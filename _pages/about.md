Short Bio
=== 

Hi! I am currently a one-year Ph.D. student in Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, co-advised by [Dr. Rui Hou](http://hourui-arch.net/) and [Dr. Mingzhe Zhang](https://mingzhe-zhang.github.io/). I received my B.E. and M.S. degree from the Shandong Normal University in 2016 and 2023, respectively.

My research interests lie in the domain of computer architecture, with a specialized focus on the design of accelerators for Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and the optimization of related HE applications.
