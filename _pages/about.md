Short Bio
=== 

<!-- Hi! I am currently a two-year Ph.D. student in Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, co-advised by [Prof. Rui Hou](http://hourui-arch.net/) and [Prof. Mingzhe Zhang](https://mingzhe-zhang.github.io/). I received my B.E. and M.S. degree from the Shandong Normal University in 2020 and 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Weizhi Xu, respectively. -->

<!-- In recent years, my research has centered on **computer architecture**, specializing in accelerator design for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and optimizing associated applications. I aim to advance practical implementation of FHE, addressing key concerns in data security and privacy.
Besides, we also post more interest in the accelerator for the Large Langes Model~(LLM). -->
In recent years, my research has focused on computer architecture, with a specialization in accelerator design for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and the optimization of its associated applications. My work aims to advance the practical implementation of FHE, addressing critical challenges in data security and privacy.

Additionally, I am increasingly exploring accelerator design for Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance their performance and efficiency.
